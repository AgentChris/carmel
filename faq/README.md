# The Carmel FAQ

We want to keep track of key concepts of Carmel, concepts that can be verbalized and visualized in a simple and concise way. The Carmel Whitepaper is great - maybe even awesome - but we want to take time to build the narrative in an even friendlier and more sharable manner. In a way that can be digested in smaller chunks - much like the Carmel Educational Micro-learning Model. Perhaps we could call this micro-storytelling. Or perhaps just plain old FAQs will do for now. So let's do this in a simple questions & answer format and go through the entire Carmel Story this way. Perfect. So first things first.

## What is Carmel?

**Carmel is a Platform that #HelpsChrisSleepAtNight.**

We're in the business of **Creating Peace of Mind** for millions of people like my friend Chris. Chris is a 40 year old father who has the type of job that can be easily replaced by robots. And the thought that he will lose his job to a machine soon, keeps him up at night, wondering, worrying, thinking about the future of his family. We created Carmel to be a one-of-a-kind Educational Platform that has one purpose and one purpose only - to give my friend Chris the skills he needs to build a future-proof career, so that he can stop worrying about the future - and instead learn to build the future. Research shows that there millions of people like Chris out there and we want to help them all.

Carmel introduces a groundbreaking Educational Model that focuses on teaching hands-on technical skills. The kind of skills Chris will need if he is to build a future-proof career. The Carmel Way is a step forward from the current educational models of traditional classroom-based and video-based learning. Our model is skills-based, decentralized and tokenized, using the concept of Peer Technical Challenges. We introduce the concept of a Carmel Token as a unit of measure for skill, much like a meter is a unit of measure for distance or a gram is a unit of measure for weight. The community creates the challenges and the community also benefits from taking the challenges while earning Experience Points, which serve as Proof of Learning.
