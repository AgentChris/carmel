# The Carmel Whitepaper

## Summary

Chris is a 40 year old father who has the type of job that can be easily replaced by robots. What keeps Chris up at night is the thought that soon, he might lose his job and not be able to provide for his family.

There are many people like Chris out there, holding down jobs that are at risk with the rise of AI machines. Robots are changing the future of work as we know it. Any job that can be done by a robot, will be done by a robot, whether we like it or not.

So what does that mean for millions of people who are at risk today?

It means that they have to learn new skills, that will give them new job opportunities in the new AI-dominated marketplace.

It means that they have to get the kind of education that will help them hit the ground running fast and start a new career as soon as humanly possible. A future-proof career. A career that will not easily be replaced by robots and one that will create ample opportunities for a better future.

In a tech-dominated era, the best career choice is to become a tech creator. One of those few people who not only survives but thrives in a tech world.

And what better way to survive in the tech world, than to become a Professional Software Developer?

**Carmel is a Decentralized Tech Education Platform that helps people like Chris acquire the technical skills they need to become Professional Software Developers without a formal computer science degree.**

## Why Decentralized?

There are several online platforms catering to people like Chris today. The problem is that they are all operating under a centralized architecture and business model, where the platform acts as a third party between teachers and students, dominating the entire teaching and learning experience.

The challenge with centralized education is that it is highly modelled around the needs of the central party running the show, while the teachers and students are treated as second class citizens in the system.

What that really means is that the power resides with the controlling party, the platform, leaving the key stakeholders of the system, the teachers and students, powerless to make key decisions.

If we want to create a model that works best for those who really want to learn and for those who want to teach, we must give them full control of the ecosystem and stay back and let them decide what's best for the community as a whole. That includes giving teachers full control of pricing and giving them 100% revenue share.

The only way to reduce our dependency on a centralized authority in a learning ecosystem, is to architect the entire model from scratch as a decentralized community consisting solely of teachers and students.

**That's precisely how Carmel is architected. As a Decentralized Community of Teachers and Students, with absolutely no dependency on a central third party authority.**
