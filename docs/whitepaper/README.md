## Summary

Chris is a 40 year old father who has the type of job that can be easily replaced by robots. What keeps Chris up at night is the thought that soon, he might lose his job and not be able to provide for his family.

There are many people like Chris out there, holding down jobs that are at risk with the rise of AI machines. Robots are changing the future of work as we know it. Any job that can be done by a robot, will be done by a robot, whether we like it or not.

So what does that mean for millions of people who are at risk today?

It means that they have to learn new skills, that will give them new job opportunities in the new AI-dominated marketplace.

It means that they have to get the kind of education that will help them hit the ground running fast and start a new career as soon as humanly possible. A future-proof career. A career that will not easily be replaced by robots and one that will create ample opportunities for a better future.

In a tech-dominated era, the best career choice is to become a tech creator. One of those few people who not only survives but thrives in a tech world.

And what better way to survive in the tech world, than to become a Professional Software Developer?

**Carmel is a Decentralized Tech Education Platform that helps people like Chris acquire the technical skills they need to become Professional Software Developers without a formal computer science degree.**

## Why Decentralized?

There are several online platforms catering to people like Chris today. The problem is that they are all operating under a centralized architecture and business model, where the platform acts as a third party between teachers and students, dominating the entire teaching and learning experience.

The challenge with centralized education is that it is highly modelled around the needs of the central party running the show, while the teachers and students are treated as second class citizens in the system.

What that really means is that the power resides with the controlling party, the platform, leaving the key stakeholders of the system, the teachers and students, powerless to make key decisions.

If we want to create a model that works best for those who really want to learn and for those who want to teach, we must give them full control of the ecosystem and stay back and let them decide what's best for the community as a whole. That includes giving teachers full control of pricing and giving them 100% revenue share.

The only way to reduce our dependency on a centralized authority in a learning ecosystem, is to architect the entire model from scratch as a decentralized community consisting solely of teachers and students.

**That's precisely how Carmel is architected. As a Decentralized Community of Teachers and Students, with absolutely no dependency on a central third party authority.**

## Educational Model

One of the major drawbacks of most available online education is that must too often it's merely an extension of the traditional classroom, using technology. In a typical online video learning model, which is dominates the current tech educational model, the teacher lectures the student via video, much like a traditional teacher would lecture students in a college classroom.

In the real world, at the office, software developers learn in a much more direct and hands-on way. They are rarely lectured and are much more self-directed. The knowledge is shared from peer to peer and the learning experience is highly personal and self-determined. The content is also broken down into much smaller pieces than a typical lecture and it's usually very specific to a problem to be solved.

Carmel is designed from scratch to implement an Educational Model that is based on solid principles collected from real-world experiences working in the Software Industry. It is a radical departure from the typical video-based lecture model and it is aimed to create a learning experience much closer to how professional software developers learn on an on-going basis, rather than mirroring how computer science is taught in a traditional college setting.

### Hands On

Learning with Carmel, the student is be exposed to a way of doing things that feels very real, as real as if they were in an office, working on a real-world problem for a real-world product. The Carmel Learning Experience ensures that every Carmel Student gets their hands dirty doing real work and at the end of the work assignment, the student does not only learn something new but also creates something new and so they gain not only raw knowledge *about* a concept but they also gain new *skills* and put them in practice right away.

### Microlearning

The hands on learning assignments are designed to be small enough to be undertaken in a few minutes of spare time. Each assignment is called a Challenge and it provides an opportunity to learn a small and specific skill about solving one problem. This is exactly how real world tech learning happens in a learning environment where software developers thrive and are continously improving their skills.

### Self-Directed

Carmel Students design their own learning path by choosing which Carmel Challenge to undertake next and when. A Carmel Learning Path is very personal in that given enough challenges, no two paths will be similar and no two paths will be undertaken the same way by two different students. One might take longer to complete a challenge and they might complete it in a different way or a different style. At the end of the day, the result will be a unique and personal Learning Journey that clearly outlines what the student knows and how well they know the concepts they've learned.

### Peer Driven

The Carmel Community is comprised of Software Developers who are at different levels in their Developer Journey. Some are brand new and others more experienced. Nonetheless, everyone always has something to learn from everyone else. Not one person will ever know enough on their own. Carmel enables each community member to contribute knowledge back into the community in the form of Carmel Challenges based on personal experience. Someone who has solves a problem in a certain way in the past has the relevant knowledge and skills to challenge someone else to acquire that same knowledge and developer those same skills. In a sense, the more a student learns, the more they can give back and also become a teacher to others.

### Story-Based

Every Carmel Developer is encouraged to keep a Developer Journal that actively documents their  Learning Journey. Each developer has their own story and others can participate in that story by connecting, conversing and engaging as their own story developers. Carmel generates story elements based on challenges that the developer has either authored or completed and there is also a measure of progress that shows how much the developer knows and what it is that they can do as a software developer.
