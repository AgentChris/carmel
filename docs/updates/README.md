We're glad to announce Carmel is starting to take shape and form. The first iteration of Carmel is the carmel.io web app. Have a look around and [let us know what you think](https://t.me/carmelplatform) - sure it ain't much yet - just stay tuned and give it a nudge and it will grow :)

Oh, yeah, have a look at the official [Carmel.io launch announcement](https://busy.org/@eosgo/eosrad-io-02-26-18-interview-with-dan-calinescu-ceo-and-co-founder-of-fluid-trends-thomas-cox-q-and-a) - broadcast live on [EOS Go](https://busy.org/@eosgo).
