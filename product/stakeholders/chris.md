## Made For Learners

This is the hero of the Carmel Story and the main protagonist. We want to come together as a community to primarily solve Chris' problem before all other problems. Remember - Chris can't sleep at night because he is worried he will lose his job to a robot. Soon. Very soon.

Chris **earns Carmel Experience Points (CARMEL XP)** for every Carmel Challenge he successfully completes. He may either **purchase Carmel Challenges** with Carmel Tokens (CARMEL) or he may receive them freely from any of the other stakeholders in the community.
