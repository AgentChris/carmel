## A Completely Decentralized & Autonomous Community

The Carmel Community is designed to be a learning community and so the primary stakeholder is and always will be the Learner - ie. Chris. But in order for Chris to be successful, our community needs to include supporting stakeholders - much like any story is simply not the same without its own supporting characters. What would Batman be without Robin... But that's for another time.
