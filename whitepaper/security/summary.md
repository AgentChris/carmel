The bulk of the cryptographic security in Carmel, resides within the Carmel Desktop App. That's where the Carmel Wallet lives and that's where blockchain transactions are signed. The way Carmel secures the Desktop App is through a secure vault, tied to the developer's machine and heavily protected by both symmetric and assymetric encryption, as well as password hashing and secure local password storage. The Carmel Vault is secured using advanced cryptographic algorithms and it is practically impossible to compromise.
