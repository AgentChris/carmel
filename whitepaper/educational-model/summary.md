# Educational Model

Carmel is designed from scratch to implement an Educational Model that is based on solid principles collected from real-world experiences working in the Software Industry. It is a radical departure from the typical video-based lecture model and it is aimed to create a learning experience much closer to how professional software developers learn on an on-going basis, rather than mirroring how computer science is taught in a traditional college setting.
