There are several online platforms catering to people like Chris today. The problem is that they are all operating under a centralized architecture and business model, where the platform acts as a third party between teachers and students, dominating the entire teaching and learning experience.

The challenge with centralized education is that it is highly modelled around the needs of the central party running the show, while the teachers and students are treated as second class citizens in the system.

What that really means is that the power resides with the controlling party, the platform, leaving the key stakeholders of the system, the teachers and students, powerless to make key decisions.

If we want to create a model that works best for those who really want to learn and for those who want to teach, we must give them full control of the ecosystem and stay back and let them decide what's best for the community as a whole. That includes giving teachers full control of pricing and giving them 100% revenue share.

The only way to reduce our dependency on a centralized authority in a learning ecosystem, is to architect the entire model from scratch as a decentralized community consisting solely of learners and value contributors.

**That's precisely how Carmel is architected. As a Decentralized Community, with absolutely no dependency on a central third party authority.**

## Community Stakeholders

The Carmel Community is designed to be a learning community and so the primary stakeholder is and always will be the Learner - ie. Chris. But in order for Chris to be successful, our community needs to include supporting stakeholders - much like any story is simply not the same without its own supporting characters. What would Batman be without Robin... But that's for another time.

So who are the supporting stakeholders in the Carmel Community?
