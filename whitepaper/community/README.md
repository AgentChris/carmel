There are several online platforms catering to people like Chris today. The problem is that they are all operating under a centralized architecture and business model, where the platform acts as a third party between teachers and students, dominating the entire teaching and learning experience.

The challenge with centralized education is that it is highly modelled around the needs of the central party running the show, while the teachers and students are treated as second class citizens in the system.

What that really means is that the power resides with the controlling party, the platform, leaving the key stakeholders of the system, the teachers and students, powerless to make key decisions.

If we want to create a model that works best for those who really want to learn and for those who want to teach, we must give them full control of the ecosystem and stay back and let them decide what's best for the community as a whole. That includes giving teachers full control of pricing and giving them 100% revenue share.

The only way to reduce our dependency on a centralized authority in a learning ecosystem, is to architect the entire model from scratch as a decentralized community consisting solely of learners and value contributors.

**That's precisely how Carmel is architected. As a Decentralized Community, with absolutely no dependency on a central third party authority.**

## Community Stakeholders

The Carmel Community is designed to be a learning community and so the primary stakeholder is and always will be the Learner - ie. Chris. But in order for Chris to be successful, our community needs to include supporting stakeholders - much like any story is simply not the same without its own supporting characters. What would Batman be without Robin... But that's for another time.

So who are the supporting stakeholders in the Carmel Community?

## Learners

**You already met Chris**.

This is the hero of the Carmel Story and the main protagonist. We want to come together as a community to primarily solve Chris' problem before all other problems. Remember - Chris can't sleep at night because he is worried he will lose his job to a robot. Soon. Very soon.

Chris **earns Carmel Experience Points (CARMEL XP)** for every Carmel Challenge he successfully completes. He may either **purchase Carmel Challenges** with Carmel Tokens (CARMEL) or he may receive them freely from any of the other stakeholders in the community.

## Developers

**What About Bob?**.

The heart of the Carmel Content, are the Carmel Challenges. No challenges - no learning - and that will make Chris very sad. We don't want that. We want to make Chris happy and always growing, always learning. That's where Bob comes in.

Bob **creates Carmel Challenges** and **earns Carmel Tokens (CARMEL)** for every challenge purchased. He keeps the bulk of the revenues, after splitting it with Auditors (other developers), who ensure his challenges are good enough to be published. He may also share tokens from every purchase with other stakeholders, based on different incentive models offered in the community.

## Carmel Teachers

**This is Alice**.

Speaking of incentive models. Carmel offers traditional tech educators - such as professors, teachers, or even schools themselves - a means to extend their in-classroom curriculum to our decentralized model.

Alice **adds Carmel Challenges to her traditional curriculum** and the school and/or the students themselves purchase those challenges (from Bob) - while Alice **earns Carmel Tokens (CARMEL)** as a share of Bob's revenue.

## Recruiters

**Meet Diane**.

If Chris does not get hired, the entire model fails. As a community - we need to encourage, help and support learners in their quest to transition to a tech career. That's crucial. And ... that's why Diane is here.

Diane **purchases Carmel Tokens (CARMEL)** and uses them to sponsor Chris in his learning journey and when he reaches a level of skill that is of interest to Diane - he automatically scores an interview. He is incentivized to grow in a direction favorable to Diane, and she is happy to use her a portion of her **Recruiting Referral** budget to sponsor Chris' growth in the direction of her choice.

## Managers

**Emma rules**.

And what happens once Chris gets hired? Is the Carmel Story over for him? Not at all. Carmel is not only about getting that first job - it's more than that. It's about **Infinite Learning** - which means we want to support Chris for the entire lifetime of his career. But once Chris gets hired, that's not possible without the support for Chris' Development Manager. That would be Emma.

Emma **purchases Carmel Tokens (CARMEL)** and uses them to sponsor Chris - on the job. Much like Diane did before Chris got hired. This **solves a tough problem** for Chris - namely, **measuring Developer Growth**. With Carmel, Emma invests a portion of her **Training Budget** in Carmel Challenges and can easily track Chris' growth, token by token.

## Entrepreneurs

**Fred is on fire**.
