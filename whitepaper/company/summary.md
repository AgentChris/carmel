The Carmel Platform is executed as a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation (DAC). Although, we much rather think of it a Community, rather than a Corporation. Carmel has its own economy, its own currency, its own members (citizens) and its own technology as well as its own rules and regulations (constitution). It's fascinating what a good blockchain technology can enable. Carmel is beyond a regular company, it's more of a living community of people who believe in a common vision.
