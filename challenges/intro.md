## Carmel Challenges (Pre-Release)

**This is a growing repository of Developer Challenges that will make up the heart of the Carmel Platform.**

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple - dare we say, centralized - way to discover New Challenges.

*Some things, discovery included, still need a tiny bit of centralization - so stay focused you decentralization zealots :)*

As the Carmel Platform evolves these challenges will also evolve, but for now, let's prove this concept and let's build the content. In other words - we want to make sure this resonates with you - looking at you Chris - and let us know if it does - or if it doesn't. Either way, [come talk to us](https://t.me/carmelplatform) and flood us with feedback. We eat feedback for breakfast. Sometimes. Usually we don't eat breakfast because we're coding on Carmel. But anyways...

The first step, is to get some of these written up and worry about the validation code later on. We want to make sure the concept makes sense first. So go through the tutorials, throw tons of feedback our way - then we'll iterate, update, etc - ie. evolve. Until ... well, we'll probably never stop evolving.

Alright, let's get started. Have a look around and enjoy your Carmel Learning Journey.
