## Carmel Challenges (Pre-Release)

**This is a growing repository of Developer Challenges that will make up the heart of the Carmel Platform.**

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple - dare we say, centralized - way to discover New Challenges.

*Some things, discovery included, still need a tiny bit of centralization - so stay focused you decentralization zealots :)*

As the Carmel Platform evolves, (some of) these Challenges will be gradually made available to browse through on the platform itself.

The first step, is to get some of these written up and worry about the validation code later on. We want to make sure the concept makes first and have people go through the tutorials, throw tons of feedback our way, iterate, update, etc - ie. evolve.

Alright, let's get started. Have a look around and enjoy your Carmel Developer Journey.
