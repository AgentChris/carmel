# The Carmel Story

This is the story of Carmel - as it happens. As with every story, this one has its main heroes and other actors, a primary plot and sub-plots, a big problem to solve - and other smaller ones - and most importantly, the Carmel Story has a Big Dream.

We want to keep track of all events, important updates but what we really want is to follow our heroes and all those committed to bringing this story to life. And we want to get to know them and even relate to them - and why not, even contribute and help them achieve their dreams.

**Dreams.**

We all have them. Consciously or unconsciously - we all have them. Big dreams. Small dreams. Dreams. It is fundamentally human to dream.

Carmel is founded on a big dream. All those involved in the Carmel Story have their own big and small dreams. But what brings us all together is that fact that we all share that one Big Carmel Dream - and perhaps even more than sharing it, it is the catalyst that brings us all a desperately needed hope that gives us the audacity to believe that a lot of our personal dreams can actually become real soon ... very soon.

If we were to express the **Carmel Dream** in a simple hashtag it would have to be **#HelpingChrisSleepAtNight** and if we were to express it in a simple math equation - because who doesn't love math equations - it would have to be **H > m**. Indeed, in a world where humans are becoming replaceable by machines, **the Carmel Dream is to help as many humans as possible achieve mastery over the machines**.

That's what this is story is all about.

Welcome to Carmel. Let's make it happen together.
