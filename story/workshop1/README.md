We started the first **#CarmelWorkshop** where we bring the local Carmel Community together, face to face, in a hands-on Learning Environment practicing what we preach - ie. **#TheCarmelWay** - peer driven and skills-based learning.

We’ve had a fun couple of hours getting our open source dev platform - Chunky - up and running on our laptops. There were bugs - can’t have those missing in a live coding session - but all in we all left energized and pumped for more of these type of meet ups.

I’m going to keep documenting this journey of not only building Carmel but of real people with real stories learning and growing and winning at life.

Definitely stay tuned if you’re into **little-guy-taking-on-the-world** stories.
