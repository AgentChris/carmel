**Andi Coman, Product Developer & Co-founder** Andi is a young, enthusiastic full-stack developer with a passion for front-end development. He began his career three years ago in a startup and loves the startup life. Some of the previous projects he worked on include a product for McDonalds, a video-based survey app and an open source React component toolkit. React is his main strength but he loves learning new technologies. Andi is a people person, loves helping others and wants to become a professional clown. Or a teacher. Or both.
