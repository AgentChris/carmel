**Chunky, Official Code Monkey & Co-founder**

Chunky is an Open Source Platform that simplifies the Software Development Process by taking care of all the tedious grunt work required to build, launch and grow great products. Chunky challenges Developers to **Imagine A World Beyond The Code And Start Creating**, instead of just focusing on the technical details. The entire Carmel Platform is built from scratch with Chunky so none of this would be possible without our amazing cute little Code Monkey.
