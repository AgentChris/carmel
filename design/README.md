# Carmel Design Artifacts

This is where all the main Carmel Design resources - like the logo for example - live. Other graphics such as infographics will go here as well. Designers can create pull-requests on this and make adjustments as they see fit.

If you're interested in becoming a #CarmelDesigner and contributing here - just do it :) Consider this your formal invitation to start adding awesome design content here and just create a pull-request.

Let's do this #CarmelDesigners - let's build a beautiful product together.
